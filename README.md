## Project Overview

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players choose a color and take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. The objective of the game is to connect four of your own discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

This project will guide you through creating a functional Connect Four game with:
- An interactive game board
- Win detection
- Custom pop-up alerts for game outcomes

## Features

- **Interactive Game Board**: A 7x7 grid where players can click to place their discs.
- **Color Switching**: The game alternates between two colors (red and yellow) for each player.
- **Win Detection**: Checks for four consecutive discs in all directions.
- **Custom Modal Popup**: Displays a message when a player wins and provides an option to restart the game.
